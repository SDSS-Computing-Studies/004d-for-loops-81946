### Assignment #004b For Loops (Total Marks 15)

Objectives:
* new variable type: tuple
* use for loop to iterate through members of a tuple
* use for loop to iterate over a sequence of integers
* continue can be used to skip over and keep iterating
* exit from a for loop using break

For loops are useful when you want to repeat a section of code a set number of
times.  The number of times can be determined by a fixed number or by a collection
of data.

### Using a TUPLE
We are going to mention a new variable type here: the TUPLE
example1.py
A tuple is a set of data that is defined as having multiple values or members.
It is defined just like a regular variable, but uses brackets to define the 
beginning and end of the tuple: 

Another way to use a tuple is to cycle through all of the members of a tuple 
using a *for* loop
example2.py

### Using a range
You can also cycle through a *for* loop using a range of numbers
example3.py
The indexing variable starts with an initial value, and continues until the
indexing value reaches the ending value.


### Note: A for loop can't be empty
If for some reason you need to execute no commands inside a for loop,
you need to use the command "pass"

example:

for i in range(3,5):
    pass
print("All done!")
